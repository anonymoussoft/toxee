// L2 host-bundle regression for the UIKit-fork MaterialApp theme-listener leak.
//
// Bug (fixed in
// third_party/chat-uikit-flutter/tencent_cloud_chat_common/lib/widgets/material_app.dart):
// `_TencentCloudChatMaterialAppState` subscribed to the global
// `TencentCloudChatTheme` event bus in `initState` but DISCARDED the
// `StreamSubscription` and had no `dispose()`. The event bus outlives the
// widget, so after the State was disposed its `_themeDataChangeCallback` still
// fired and called `setState()` on an unmounted State. In a shared test
// isolate this surfaced when a SECOND app mounted and ran
// `TencentCloudChatTheme.init` (during `_getLocale → cache.init`): the init
// event was delivered to the FIRST, already-disposed subscriber →
// "setState() called after dispose()" reported after the prior test completed.
// That leak is exactly why the other L2 smokes are one-test-per-file.
//
// The fix retains the subscription, cancels it in a new `dispose()`, and guards
// the callback with `mounted`.
//
// This regression reproduces the leak within a SINGLE test: mount the app
// (subscribes a `_TencentCloudChatMaterialAppState` to the bus) → dispose it by
// pumping a bare widget → RE-mount the app, which re-fires a
// `TencentCloudChatTheme` event on the global bus (from
// `EchoUIKitApp.initState`'s `_syncUIKitThemeBrightness`, main.dart:~223, and
// again via `TencentCloudChatTheme.init` during `_getLocale → cache.init`).
// Pre-fix, the
// first, now-disposed subscriber received that event and called `setState()`
// on an unmounted State; the framework surfaces it via `takeException()`. With
// the fix the first subscription was cancelled on dispose, so the re-mount is
// clean.
//
// One `testWidgets` (not two): a host-bundle file under `-d macos` uses
// LiveTestWidgetsFlutterBinding, which asserts in postTest across multiple
// `testWidgets` — so the mount→dispose→remount sequence lives inside one test.
