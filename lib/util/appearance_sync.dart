/// MaterialApp (driven by [AppTheme] / [AppLocale]) and the embedded
/// TencentCloudChat UIKit surfaces (conversation list / chat panel), which
/// follow their own controller ([TencentCloudChat.controller] brightness,
/// [TencentCloudChatIntl] locale). Changing only one side produces a
/// mixed-theme / mixed-locale UI.
///
/// These functions are the single source of truth for switching both sides
/// together. Callers: the Settings page rows
/// (`global_settings_section.dart`) and the L3 harness setter
/// (`l3_set_setting{themeMode|languageCode}` in `l3_debug_tools.dart`) used
/// by the product-screenshot pipeline.

/// Apply [mode] to the app theme AND the UIKit brightness in one step.
///
/// For [ThemeMode.system] the UIKit side needs a concrete [Brightness]; pass
/// the widget-tree value (`MediaQuery.platformBrightnessOf(context)`) when a
/// context is available — headless callers fall back to the
/// [PlatformDispatcher] value, which is the same source one hop earlier.
