## Mission

Implement, serially on master:
- **P1**: 17 new real-app real-widget scenarios (no production change expected;
  tiny automation-only keys allowed where verify-first reading shows a keyless
  load-bearing surface — precedented).
- **P2**: 8 seam/key-gated items (fork keys, l3 seed seam, `ui_long_press`,
  presence-dot semantics, 3 verify-first investigations).
- **P3**: the writable subset (perf burst variant, ar/RTL verify-first,
  platform run plan); platform RUNS (iOS/Android/Win11) are run-phase tasks.

## HARD CONSTRAINTS (this campaign)

1. **WRITE-PHASE FIRST.** Write all batches with hermetic verification only;
   the run phase comes after the write phase closes (campaign-proven protocol).
   ~~Parallel-session hot-file rules~~ — LIFTED 2026-06-10: the user cancelled
   the parallel run session and granted full file access ("已经取消并行会话，
   你可以对所有文件做修改和重写"). All files editable; its coherent toxee-side
   WIP was archived (see Batch log); its tim2tox-submodule native WIP
   (`ffi/dart_compat_friendship.cpp`, uncommitted) is left in place for the
   run-phase owner — do not revert, do not commit blind.
2. Commit per batch with EXPLICIT file adds (never `git add -A`; the tree may
   hold run artifacts like `*.png` and the dirty tim2tox submodule).
3. Standing rules apply: real-UI first (l3 only for seeding/navigation-stability,
   never the asserted action); verify-first by READING current code (don't trust
   doc conclusions); soft-skip with evidence; deep root-cause fixes; mobile
   parity noted per change; codex review per batch (telemetry-off:
   `env -u OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT codex exec -c otel.exporter=none
   -c otel.log_user_prompt=false …`).

## Per-batch contract (every batch MUST)

1. Read this file + `doc/research/REAL_APP_UI_TEST_INVENTORY.md` (its case row)
   + `tool/mcp_test/REAL_UI_TWO_PROCESS.md` + the files in the File map below.
2. New scenarios live in a NEW part file (`drive_real_ui_pair_p1_*.dart` /
   `_p2_*.dart`), declared in `drive_real_ui_pair.dart`'s part list, dispatched
   per-case + as a `sweep_<batch>` chain (per-case `[sweep] <case>: PASS|FAIL|
   SKIP(<reason>)` + final counts; exit non-zero if any hard case fails; exit 75
   = SKIP for individual dispatch), registered in `_validRealUiScenarios` +
   `_requiredRealUiState` + `_resultRealUiState` + a `rui-p1-*` campaign.
3. Gates (all green before commit): `flutter analyze lib tool --no-fatal-warnings
   --no-fatal-infos` 0 NEW issues; `dart run tool/mcp_test/fixture_c_unified_runner.dart
   --plan-json --class=2proc-ui` exit 0; `--validate-only` exit 0;
   `--list-real-ui-campaigns` shows the new campaign; driver
   `--self-test-shell-recovery` PASS; touched hermetic tests pass;
   `dart run tool/mcp_test/gen_scenario_index.dart --check` green.
4. Codex review; apply findings; update this file's Status + Batch log;
   `git commit` (message: `test(real-ui): p1p2p3 batch <N> — <domain> (written, unrun)`).
5. Do NOT update `test/mcp/S*.md` headers to claim coverage — written-unrun
   scenarios are not validated gates yet; header updates happen in the run phase.

## Batches

### Batch I — `ui_long_press` primitive (prereq for P1 #8 + mobile-trigger parity)

`lib/ui/testing/ui_drive_tools.dart`: `ui_long_press` {key?|x,y?, holdMs?} —
real touch PointerDown → await hold (default 600 ms > kLongPressTimeout) →
PointerUp through `GestureBinding.handlePointerEvent`. Register in
`registerUiDriveToolsIfDebug()`. Hermetic gates in
`test/ui/testing/ui_drive_tools_test.dart`: onLongPress fires once (and onTap
does NOT); offstage/absent key errors. FakeAsync note: test starts the handler
future un-awaited, `tester.pump(700ms)` advances fake time, then awaits it.
**STATUS: DONE** (5th ui_drive tool + `Inst.longPressKey`; hermetic gates 8/8
incl. 3 new long-press cases — fires-once/not-tap, short-hold-is-tap negative
control, key_not_found shape; analyze 222/0-new; planner + INDEX green; codex
round-1 found 1 P2: the fork's conversation rows use a CUSTOM
`LongPressGestureRecognizer(duration: 650 ms)` (`tencent_cloud_chat_gesture.dart:117`)
so the 600 ms default would release early and fall through as a TAP (= navigation
on a conv row) → default hold raised to 800 ms everywhere, docs cite both
deadlines. Durable fact: any long-press driving of fork gesture surfaces must
hold >650 ms, not just >500 ms.)

### Batch II — P1 single-instance quintet (`drive_real_ui_pair_p1_single.dart`)

| case | inventory row | verify-first reading needed |
|---|---|---|
| `account_card_management_menu` | P1#8 | login_page.dart: card long-press/secondary trigger? menu surface keys? uses `ui_long_press` |
| `account_delete_full_flow` | P1#9 | settings 注销 flow keys + confirm dialog; throwaway account via real RegisterPage |
| `settings_switch_account_entry` | P1#10 | settings switch-account entry key → login cards → switch back |
| `conference_rename_leave` | P1#11 | reuse batch-7 helpers for AVChatRoom create; rename + leave confirm-by-label |
| `zh_locale_page_walk` | P1#12 | per-page zh labels (外观 etc.); revert-to-en discipline (batch-1 locale finding) |

Sweep `sweep_p1_single` · campaign `rui-p1-single` · state no-friend→no-friend.
**STATUS: DONE (written, unrun)** — 5/5 WRITTEN, 0 SKIP (every surface verified
to exist by reading production code). Part file ~1130 LOC (agent-written, this
session completed registration + fixes after a session-limit interrupt).
Production changes: 4 automation-only keys (per-account
`settings_account_switch_button:<toxId>` on the _AccountCardItem swap
IconButton; `settings_delete_account_button` opener;
`settings_delete_account_confirm_input` on BOTH mutually-exclusive dialog
branches; `settings_delete_account_confirm_button`) + a new read-only
`savedAccountToxIds` l3_dump_state field (persisted account-list ground truth).
Verify-first findings: the settings switch entry does a DIRECT in-place switch
(account_switcher tears down + boots + pushAndRemoveUntil(HomePage), NEVER via
LoginPage); the login-card management menu opens via onLongPress AND
onSecondaryTap (login_page.dart:1124/1129) with production-keyed Export/Delete
options; delete-account uses a RANDOM typed confirm word read from the live
prompt (extraction failure → production rejects → loud FAIL, never a stray
deletion). Gates: analyze 222/0-new; plan-json/validate/campaign-list/INDEX/
self-test green; settings+testing hermetic 78/78. Codex round-1: 2 P1 + 3 P2 —
P1 standalone-switch leaves throwaway #2 (now real-delete-cleaned + gated),
P1 endClean ignored by sweep exit (now `failed==0 && endClean`, and
noLeftover proven against savedAccountToxIds), P2 delete needs persisted
ground truth (dumpGone added), P2 dialog-opener tapKey fallbacks could
double-fire (new `_p1OpenDialogViaKey` bounds-gated discipline; also fixed the
inherited group2 leave-button opener), P2.5 l3_open_add_group_dialog flagged —
DISAGREED with precedent (batch-7 navigation-stability exception; keyed real
entry noted as future upgrade). Confirm round: all RESOLVED + 1 new P2
([] savedAccountToxIds ambiguous on read error → primary-sentinel trust gate,
applied).

### Batch III — P1 two-process chat/conv octet (`drive_real_ui_pair_p1_chat.dart`)

| case | inventory row | verify-first reading needed |
|---|---|---|
| `chat_recall_message` | P1#3 | fork menu: recall item on fresh self msg; revoke path in bridge (stub? → honest scope) |
| `read_receipt_double_tick` | P1#4 | read-status icon keyed? (likely needs automation-only fork key) |
| `forward_to_group_target` | P1#5 | batch-7 group helpers + S17 picker keys |
| `draft_restore_on_conv_switch` | P1#6 | does the fork write/restore drafts? (DartSetConversationDraft exists natively) |
| `typing_indicator_render` | P1#7 | does any UI surface render typing? (fixture_c_typing = data half) |
| `unread_badge_total_sidebar` | P1#13 | sidebar Chats badge key/text |
| `search_empty_state` | P1#14 | custom_search empty-state marker |
| `image_preview_open_hardened` | P1#16 | bounded retry-tap; honest best-effort fallback |

Sweep `sweep_p1_chat` · campaign `rui-p1-chat` · friends→friends.
Open design questions for the batch agent (verify by READING code, then decide
gate shape honestly): does any UI render typing (else NEGATIVE gate or SKIP)?
does the fork restore drafts on conv switch-back (else record the gap)? is the
recall path wired through the bridge (else honest UI-half scope)? is the ✓✓
read-status icon keyed (else an automation-only fork key is the precedented fix,
and the assert must distinguish peer-READ from mere send-success)?
**STATUS: DONE (written, unrun)** — 8/8 WRITTEN, 0 SKIP. Five positive gates
(`chat_recall_message`, `forward_to_group_target`, `unread_badge_total_sidebar`,
`search_empty_state`, `image_preview_open_hardened`) plus three evidence-backed
NEGATIVE product-gap pins (`read_receipt_double_tick`, `draft_restore_on_conv_switch`,
`typing_indicator_render`). Production/fork changes: new part file +
driver/runner registration (`sweep_p1_chat`, `rui-p1-chat`); desktop sidebar
and mobile bottom-nav unread-badge Text keys (`sidebar_chats_unread_badge`,
`home_chats_unread_badge`); fork keys `chat_header_title_text`,
`message_viewer_root`, and state-suffixed
`message_send_status:<msgID>:<read|sent|other>`. Verify-first findings are
recorded at the top of `drive_real_ui_pair_p1_chat.dart`: recall is wired
through a best-effort `__revoke__:` bridge but B-side live tombstone rendering
is a fork listener gap; C2C read receipts do not wire from chat-open and cannot
correlate msgIDs; desktop drafts never save and the platform draft path is not
usable for this UI route; typing has a data half (`l3_set_typing`) but no
production sender or UI consumer. Gates: `flutter analyze lib tool
--no-fatal-warnings --no-fatal-infos` = 222 baseline / 0 new; plan-json,
validate-only, campaign-list (`rui-p1-chat` present), `--self-test-shell-recovery`,
and `gen_scenario_index.dart --check` all green; `flutter test test/ui/chat
test/ui/home test/ui/settings test/ui/testing` = 139/139. Codex review:
SKIPPED per explicit user directive for this handoff turn. Mobile parity:
unread badge key lands on the shared mobile bottom-nav host, and fork message
keys live in shared message widgets.

### Batch IV — P1 relaunch trio + calls (`drive_real_ui_pair_p1_relaunch.dart`)

| case | inventory row | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `relaunch_history_autologin` | P1#1 | seed via real composer → relaunch A → autoLogin → history rows render |
| `offline_pending_relaunch` | P1#2 | stop B → A real send → SENDING spinner row → relaunch B → delivered |
| `call_from_profile_tiles` | P1#15 | `friend_profile_voice_call_tile`/`friend_profile_video_call_tile` (fork :437/:455) |
| `group_join_by_id_real_ui` | P1#17 | verify-first AddGroupDialog join path; product-gap record if absent |

Runner: add `_realUiStateRelaunchDirty = 'relaunch-dirty'` result state (the
existing unknown-state else-branch already stop+relaunches — verified at
`fixture_c_unified_runner.dart:1075`/`:1614`; check `_restoreForRealUiState`'s
default for the unknown state). Relaunch helper = fn in the new part
(stop/launch scripts + `instance.json` re-read + fresh `Inst`/`_reconnect`;
dispose the stale vm client first). Design intent: assert the pending spinner
BEFORE relaunching B (don't race it); gate call cases on both-idle like batch 8;
verify-first whether AddGroupDialog has any join-by-id path (likely absent →
negative product-gap gate, S33 stays 2proc-l3).
**STATUS: DONE (written, unrun)** — 4/4 WRITTEN, 0 SKIP. Added
`drive_real_ui_pair_p1_relaunch.dart` plus dispatch/runner registration
(`sweep_p1_relaunch`, `rui-p1-relaunch`) and the runner result state
`relaunch-dirty`, which intentionally forces the next external scenario through
the existing stop+launch branch. `Inst.pid` is now mutable so a one-instance
relaunch can keep using the same driver object while foregrounding the new
process. Fork change: the existing state-suffixed message-status key contract
now covers the SENDING spinner as
`message_send_status:<msgID>:sending`, letting `offline_pending_relaunch` assert
the real spinner before B is relaunched. Verify-first correction: contrary to
the handoff guess, `AddGroupDialog` DOES have a real join-by-ID path
(`add_group_join_id_input`, `add_group_join_message_input`, alias field, and
`service.joinGroup(...)`), so `group_join_by_id_real_ui` is a positive real-UI
case rather than a product-gap negative. Relaunch helper uses
`stop_toxee_instance.sh <A|B>` + `launch_toxee_instance.sh <A|B>`; the launch
script preserves per-instance prefs/app support, writes fresh `instance.json`,
and the driver re-reads pid/ws, reconnects, waits `sessionReady` +
`currentAccountToxId`, then returns home. Codex review: SKIPPED per explicit
user directive for this handoff turn. Gates: analyze 222/0-new; plan-json,
validate-only, campaign-list (`rui-p1-relaunch` present), shell recovery
self-test, and INDEX all green; `flutter test test/ui/chat test/ui/call
test/ui/contact test/ui/add_group_dialog_test.dart test/ui/conference
test/ui/testing` = 135/135. Mobile parity: the sending-status key lives in the
shared fork message widget; driver scenarios remain desktop real-UI write-phase
cases.

### Batch V — P2 fork keys + scenarios (`drive_real_ui_pair_p2_keys.dart`)

sticker per-cell key → `sticker_face_cell_send`; new-messages chip key →
`new_messages_chip_tap`; presence-dot semantic state → `presence_dot_relaunch`
(uses relaunch class). Fork commits FIRST (submodule), then toxee SHA bump.
**STATUS: DONE (written, unrun)** — 3/3 WRITTEN, 0 SKIP. Fork commit
`9e72f4d` adds shared Dart automation selectors for sticker pack tabs/cells
(`sticker_face_tab:<pack>`, `sticker_face_cell:<pack>:<cell>`), a RenderObject
new-message chip wrapper key (`new_messages_chip`), and state-suffixed presence
dot keys (`conversation_item_online_dot:<convId>:online|offline`) while
preserving the legacy unsuffixed dot key. Added `drive_real_ui_pair_p2_keys.dart`
plus dispatch/runner registration (`sweep_p2_keys`, `rui-p2-keys`) and state
contracts. Positive cases: `sticker_face_cell_send` drives the real sticker
panel and asserts local FACE elemType 8; B-side receive currently arrives as
`__face__:` text because tim2tox serializes face metadata over the wire, so rich
receiver rendering is a later bridge/fork concern, not faked here.
`new_messages_chip_tap` scrolls A upward, receives a real B message, taps the
real chip, and asserts the newest row is visible. `presence_dot_relaunch` stops
and relaunches B while asserting the suffixed online/offline dot keys on A.
Codex review: SKIPPED per explicit user directive for this handoff turn. Gates:
analyze 222/0-new; plan-json, validate-only, campaign-list (`rui-p2-keys`
present), shell recovery self-test, and INDEX all green; focused widget tests
5/5; related UI tests `test/ui/chat test/ui/conversation test/ui/testing` =
78/78. Mobile parity: all three fork keys live in shared Dart widgets used by
desktop/mobile surfaces; the driver remains a desktop two-process write-phase
case set.

### Batch VI — P2 reply two-piece (`drive_real_ui_pair_p2_reply.dart`)

l3 C2C custom-elem inbound seed seam (mirror `l3_inject_group_text` →
`ingestInboundGroupText` seam family) + fork reply-container ValueKey +
`reply_quote_real`. **STATUS: DONE (written, unrun)** — 1/1 WRITTEN, 0 SKIP.
Fork commit `86cade8` adds the shared reply banner selector
`message_input_reply_container` to
`TencentCloudChatMessageInputReplyContainer`. tim2tox commit `65562f1` adds a
Dart-only C2C custom inbound seam (`ingestInboundC2cCustom`), preserves the
pre-existing native WIP in `ffi/dart_compat_friendship.cpp` untouched, and
projects `ChatMessage.mediaKind == custom` into a TIM custom elem in the
platform converter. Root adds the test-account-gated l3 tool
`l3_inject_c2c_custom`, `drive_real_ui_pair_p2_reply.dart`, dispatch/runner
registration (`sweep_p2_reply`, `rui-p2-reply`), and explicit state contracts.
`reply_quote_real` uses l3 only to seed a quotable inbound custom bubble, then
drives the real message menu Reply action, waits for the keyed quote banner,
sends through the real composer, verifies sender-side `messageReply`
cloudCustomData points at the injected message/sender, and asserts B receives
the reply body. Existing wire behavior still leaves reply metadata sender-side,
so B-side quote metadata is not asserted. Codex review: SKIPPED per explicit
user directive for this handoff turn. Gates: focused desktop reply widget test
6/6, new FFI C2C custom ingest test 1/1, driver/runner/l3 analyze 2 baseline
infos/0 fatal, planner plan-json, validate-only, campaign-list (`rui-p2-reply`
present), corrected campaign plan-json under `--class=2proc-ui`, shell recovery
self-test, INDEX check, `git diff --check`, root `flutter analyze lib tool
--no-fatal-warnings --no-fatal-infos` = 222 baseline/0 fatal, and related tests
`test/ui/chat test/ui/testing test/ffi_chat_service_c2c_custom_ingest_test.dart`
= 54/54. Mobile parity: the reply banner key and custom-ingest bridge are shared
Dart surfaces; the new driver remains a desktop two-process write-phase case.

### Batch VII — P2 verify-first trio (voice / paste / tray)

Read-code investigations; scenario if surface exists, else evidence-based
product-gap entry HERE + inventory doc cross-ref. **STATUS: DONE (written,
unrun)** — 1/3 WRITTEN, 2/3 EVIDENCE-BASED NO-NEW-DRIVER. Fork commit
`ec3e314` adds the desktop pasted-image confirmation selector
`desktop_send_image_confirm_button`. Root adds `drive_real_ui_pair_p2_verify.dart`
plus dispatch/runner registration (`sweep_p2_verify`, `rui-p2-verify`) and a
source guard for the new selector. `paste_image_into_composer` writes a tiny PNG
to the macOS image clipboard, focuses the real composer (`chat_input_text_field`),
drives the production Cmd+V RawKeyEvent path, taps the real keyed image-send
confirmation, then asserts A has a new self `mediaKind=image` paste message and
B receives the same image filename. Verify-first evidence: the desktop paste
handler exists at
`tencent_cloud_chat_message_input_desktop.dart:499-553`, and the confirmation
button is keyed at `image_tools.dart:75-77`.

Voice: no new Batch VII driver. Desktop voice exists
(`tencent_cloud_chat_message_input_desktop.dart:397-416`), but S78 is already
explicitly L3-pinned because the record dialog gates on a real microphone/TCC
and end-to-end delivery needs a second live process receiving over DHT
(`test/mcp/S78_voice_message_record_send.md:6-17`). Existing coverage remains
`run_fixture_c_voice_msg.sh` plus
`test/ui/mobile/mobile_voice_record_real_ui_test.dart`; adding a write-phase
desktop driver would be un-verifiable without the deferred run phase.

Tray: no new Batch VII driver. The tray shell exists
(`app_tray.dart:24-31`, `app_tray.dart:340-345`), but the actual window close
path is destroy, not hide-to-tray: the frame close button calls
`windowManager.close()` (`desktop_window_frame.dart:140-143`) and
`onWindowClose()` persists bounds then calls `windowManager.destroy()`
(`desktop_shell_bootstrap.dart:13-29`). Therefore the inventory's
"close-window -> tray/Dock restore" behavior is a product gap rather than a
driveable real-UI surface. Codex review: SKIPPED per explicit user directive for
this handoff turn. Gates: driver/runner/source analyze no issues, fork
`image_tools.dart` analyze 3 baseline infos/0 fatal, planner plan-json,
validate-only, campaign-list (`rui-p2-verify` present), corrected campaign
plan-json under `--class=2proc-ui`, shell recovery self-test, INDEX check,
`git diff --check`, source guard `dart run`, root `flutter analyze lib tool
--no-fatal-warnings --no-fatal-infos` = 222 baseline/0 fatal,
`test/ui/testing` = 19/19, and related tests `test/ui/chat test/ui/testing` =
53/53.

### Batch VIII — P3 writable subset

`message_burst_perf` (param count + timing, nonBlocking threshold); `ar_rtl_smoke`
(verify ar locale exists; Directionality assert); platform run plan section
(iOS sim / Android / Win11) written here for the run-phase owner. **STATUS: TODO**

## File map (pre-baked anchors for batch agents)

- `lib/ui/testing/ui_drive_tools.dart` (398 LOC): pure handlers + thin MCP entries;
  `resolveKeyCenter` (onstage walk), `_nextPointerId`, `registerUiDriveToolsIfDebug`
  (registered in `main.dart` right after l3 registration, UNGATED kDebugMode-only).
  Hermetic tests: `test/ui/testing/ui_drive_tools_test.dart` (5/5, FakeAsync notes inline).
- `tool/mcp_test/drive_real_ui_pair.dart` (865 LOC): part list :116-131; per-domain
  dispatch switches (batch 4 @~404, 5 @~508, 6 @~589); `settings_sweep` @204,
  `probe_home_root` @727. Add new parts + dispatch entries append-style.
- `tool/mcp_test/drive_real_ui_pair_inst.dart` (READ-ONLY, HOT): `Inst` API —
  ctor `Inst(name, ws, pid)` + `connect()`; `skill()`/`l3()`/`dumpState()`;
  `tapKey/tryTapKey/tapText/tapAt/tapKeyCenter/tapKeyAt/focusType/keyCenter`;

  osaClear`; `markAccountTest/unmarkAccountTest`; `_reconnect()/_refreshWsUriFromRuntime()`
  (private, same-library callable); `shot(path)`.
- `tool/mcp_test/fixture_c_unified_runner.dart`: `_validRealUiScenarios` @57;
  campaigns map (after the registry); `_requiredRealUiState` @1110 (default at switch
  end); `_resultRealUiState` @1281; symbolic planner @1046 (unknown-state else =
  stop+launch @1075); live executor @1590 (else @1614); `_realUiSkipExitCode` = 75;
  `_internalRealUiResetScenario` @445.
- `lib/ui/testing/ui_keys.dart`: ValueKey catalog (UiKeys.*).
- `lib/ui/testing/l3_debug_tools.dart`: l3 tool registration pattern; test-account
  gate `_activeAccountIsTest` @~377; ungated plumbing precedents
  (`l3_open_group_member_list`, `l3_mark_current_account_test`).
- Fork key precedents: `tencent_cloud_chat_user_profile_body.dart` (call tiles
  :437/:455), `tencent_cloud_chat_message_input_sticker_panel.dart`
  (`desktop_sticker_panel`), `tencent_cloud_chat_group_member_list.dart`
  (member row + kick item keys), `message_list.dart:604` (keyless new-messages chip),
  `conversation_item_online_dot:<convId>` (color-only dot).
- Campaign precedents to copy shape from: `drive_real_ui_pair_settings2.dart`
  (sweep + per-case + normalize-between-cases), `drive_real_ui_pair_login.dart`
  (state-machine order + end-clean guard), `drive_real_ui_pair_group2.dart`
  (2p group prereqs + l3 nav-stability opens).

## Run phase (DEFERRED — owned by a later session)

After sweeps 4–8 finish AND this campaign's write phase closes: rebuild via
`MCP_BINDING=skill TOXEE_BUILD_ONLY=1 ./run_toxee.sh`, run `rui-p1-*`/`rui-p2-*`
campaigns serially, root-cause fixes, then update S*.md headers + INDEX for
validated gates only.

## Batch log (append-only)

- 2026-06-10: anchor created. Parallel session was live-running sweep_contacts
  run phase (commits 125b335, 9c3cedf); user then CANCELLED it and granted full
  file access. Its coherent toxee-side WIP archived as commit 8b62c56
  (focusType always-paste — keystroke mangles even short strings; case-40 remark
  asserts the Prefs-backed `friends[].remark`, root-causing the "expected native
  FAIL" as a wrong-field harness assert). Its tim2tox native WIP
  (`ffi/dart_compat_friendship.cpp`, uncommitted in the submodule) left in place
  — the run-phase owner decides whether the Platform-path finding makes it
  unnecessary (likely) or complementary (binary-replacement path parity).
  Sweep 4–8 run state: sweep_contacts was mid-run when cancelled; sweeps 5–8
  unrun. Instance state unknown — the run phase re-launches fresh.

- 2026-06-10 **Batch I DONE** (`ui_long_press` + `Inst.longPressKey`). Gates:
  analyze 222 (0 NEW), `ui_drive_tools_test.dart` 8/8, planner `--plan-json`
  exit 0, INDEX `--check` green. Codex (1 round): 1 P2 — fork conversation rows
  long-press at a CUSTOM 650 ms (`tencent_cloud_chat_gesture.dart:117-118`), so
  the 600 ms default hold would release early and fall through as a TAP →
  default raised to 800 ms in the handler, the MCP description, and
  `Inst.longPressKey`; the hermetic default-path test pumps 900 ms. Anchor
  CORRECTION in the same commit: the initially committed anchor pre-filled
  batch I–IV Status as DONE with invented outcomes (drafting error) — reverted
  to TODO + plan-note wording; only ACTUAL results may live in Status fields.

- 2026-06-11 **Batch II DONE (written, unrun)**. The batch agent hit the session
  limit after writing the part file + part declaration; this session completed
  dispatcher routing, runner registration (registry/campaign/both state
  tables), the 4 production keys the scenarios drive (the agent wrote against
  planned-but-unadded keys — every driven key then verified to resolve), the
  `savedAccountToxIds` dump field, gates, and 2 codex rounds (see Batch II
  Status). Durable gotchas: (1) flutter_skill `getTextContent` only surfaces
  Text/RichText — a SelectableText payload must be read from a neighboring
  prompt Text (the delete confirm word case); (2) the settings switch entry
  never routes through LoginPage (in-place teardown+boot) — asserting "lands on
  login cards" would have been a wrong-shape gate; (3) an empty l3 list field
  is ambiguous on read error — gate absence verdicts on a sentinel the list
  must contain (here: the primary toxId).

- 2026-06-11 **Batch III DONE (written, unrun)**. Added
  `drive_real_ui_pair_p1_chat.dart` and registered `sweep_p1_chat` /
  `rui-p1-chat`. Wrote all 8 P1 chat/conv cases; `read_receipt_double_tick`,
  `draft_restore_on_conv_switch`, and `typing_indicator_render` are NEGATIVE
  product-gap pins with read-code evidence instead of fake positive gates.
  Added automation-only keys for unread badge rendering (desktop sidebar +
  mobile bottom nav) and fork chat surfaces (open header title, media viewer
  root, state-suffixed send-status icon). Gates green: analyze 222/0-new,
  planner plan-json, validate-only, campaign-list, shell recovery self-test,
  INDEX check, and touched UI tests 139/139. Codex review deliberately skipped
  for this batch per the 2026-06-11 handoff instruction ("里面提到的codex审查的要求，
  先不做审查"). Durable gotchas: (1) `Text` keys must be inserted after the
  positional text argument, not before it; (2) `dart format` on fork files causes
  massive unrelated churn, so keep fork key edits surgical; (3) read-receipt
  assertions must prove the receiver's local unread was nonzero before opening
  the row, or the negative gate is vacuous.

- 2026-06-11 **Batch IV DONE (written, unrun)**. Added
  `drive_real_ui_pair_p1_relaunch.dart` and registered `sweep_p1_relaunch` /
  `rui-p1-relaunch`; added `_realUiStateRelaunchDirty` so internally restarted
  pair metadata is never reused by the next external scenario. Wrote all four
  P1 relaunch/profile cases: history survives A relaunch + autologin,
  offline-pending asserts the real SENDING spinner key before relaunching B,
  friend-profile voice/video tiles place real calls with both-idle guards, and
  group join-by-ID drives the real AddGroupDialog join card. Fork addition:
  `message_send_status:<msgID>:sending` on the sending spinner (same shared
  message widget contract as Batch III's read/sent keys). Verify-first gotcha:
  AddGroupDialog's join-by-ID path exists despite the handoff note; do not pin
  this as a product gap. Gates green: analyze 222/0-new, planner plan-json,
  validate-only, campaign-list, shell recovery self-test, INDEX check, and
  related UI tests 135/135. Codex review deliberately skipped per the user
  instruction for this turn.

- 2026-06-11 **Batch V DONE (written, unrun)**. Fork commit `9e72f4d` adds the
  P2 selector surfaces required by this batch: sticker tabs/cells, a
  RenderObject-backed `new_messages_chip`, and state-suffixed presence-dot keys
  while preserving the legacy presence-dot key. Added
  `drive_real_ui_pair_p2_keys.dart` and registered `sweep_p2_keys` /
  `rui-p2-keys`. Wrote all three P2 cases: real sticker-face send, real
  new-message chip tap after an off-bottom inbound message, and relaunch-driven
  online/offline presence dot. Verify-first gotcha: sender-side sticker send is
  a true FACE elemType 8, but the current tim2tox wire projection reaches B as
  `__face__:` text; do not pretend receiver rich-face rendering exists until the
  bridge/fork grows it. Gates green: analyze 222/0-new, planner plan-json,
  validate-only, campaign-list, shell recovery self-test, INDEX check, focused
  widget tests 5/5, and related UI tests 78/78. Codex review deliberately
  skipped per the user instruction for this turn.

- 2026-06-11 **Batch VI DONE (written, unrun)**. Fork commit `86cade8` adds the
  shared `message_input_reply_container` key. tim2tox commit `65562f1` adds the
  Dart-only C2C custom inbound seam and custom elem projection, while leaving
  the pre-existing native `ffi/dart_compat_friendship.cpp` WIP untouched and
  uncommitted. Root adds `l3_inject_c2c_custom`, the
  `drive_real_ui_pair_p2_reply.dart` case file, `sweep_p2_reply`, and
  `rui-p2-reply`. `reply_quote_real` seeds only the inbound custom bubble via
  l3, then drives real Reply menu selection, verifies the keyed quote banner,
  sends through the real composer, asserts sender-side `messageReply`
  cloudCustomData references the seeded message/sender, and checks B receives
  the reply body. Current bridge behavior does not expose receiver-side reply
  metadata, so that remains a documented product gap. Gates green: focused
  widget/service tests 7/7, driver/runner/l3 analyze with 2 baseline infos and
  0 fatal, planner plan-json, validate-only, campaign-list, corrected
  `rui-p2-reply` plan-json under `--class=2proc-ui`, shell recovery self-test,
  INDEX check, `git diff --check`, root analyze 222/0-fatal, and related tests
  54/54. Codex review deliberately skipped per the user instruction for this
  turn.

- 2026-06-11 **Batch VII DONE (written, unrun)**. Verify-first resolved the
  voice / paste-image / tray trio honestly: fork commit `ec3e314` adds
  `desktop_send_image_confirm_button`, and root adds
  `drive_real_ui_pair_p2_verify.dart`, `sweep_p2_verify`, and `rui-p2-verify`.
  The written hard case is `paste_image_into_composer`: macOS image clipboard
  seed -> real composer Cmd+V -> real keyed image confirmation -> sender/receiver
  `mediaKind=image` dump assertions. Voice gets no new write-phase driver
  because the current evidence pins it to S78's real-mic/TCC + live DHT gate
  (`run_fixture_c_voice_msg.sh` plus the mobile record widget test). Tray gets
  no fake close-to-tray driver because the implemented close path destroys the
  window instead of hiding it to tray; AppTray can show/focus when present, but
  close-window restore is a product gap. Gates green: driver/runner/source
  analyze no issues, fork image-tools analyze 3 baseline infos/0 fatal,
  planner plan-json, validate-only, campaign-list, corrected `rui-p2-verify`
  plan-json under `--class=2proc-ui`, shell recovery self-test, INDEX check,
  source guard direct dart run, `git diff --check`, root analyze 222/0-fatal,
  `test/ui/testing` 19/19, and related tests 53/53. Codex review deliberately
  skipped per the user instruction for this turn.
