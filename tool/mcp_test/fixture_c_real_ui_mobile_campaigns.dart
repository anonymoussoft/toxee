// Mobile real-UI campaign catalog (iPhone / iPad / Android).
//
// Split out of `fixture_c_unified_runner.dart` so the runner stays under its
// `tool/.complexity_baseline.txt` pin: the campaign map is DATA plus the
// rationale for each grouping, and it grew faster than the runner's logic.
// The runner merges this map into `_realUiCampaigns`, so `--real-ui-campaign=`,
// `--list-real-ui-campaigns` and the rui-ipad-* device-type override all keep
// working unchanged.
//
// Each value is an ORDERED list of sweep scenario names; the runner keeps one
// pair launch alive across the whole list and inserts an in-place
// friendship reset (`_executeInternalRealUiReset`) only when the previous
// sweep's RESULT state differs from the next sweep's REQUIRED state.

const mobileRealUiCampaigns = <String, List<String>>{
  // Every sweep registered below declares `required=no-friend`, and the
  // friends->no-friend transition is done IN PLACE by
  // `_executeInternalRealUiReset()` (no relaunch), so any ORDER is self
  // consistent. The chains are still ordered `result=no-friend` sweeps FIRST so
  // the runner does not have to insert a reset between them.
  //
  // BUDGET / SIMULATOR LIFECYCLE: any campaign here that chains >= 2 sweeps
  // must be launched with `export TOXEE_IOS_KEEP_SIMULATOR_FRONT=1` on
  // iOS/iPadOS. A backgrounded Simulator has its apps reclaimed by iOS after
  // ~2-3 min (see launch_toxee_ios_instance.sh) — App Nap disable + caffeinate
  // do NOT help — which kills a long chain mid-run. The runner only PASSES
  // THROUGH `Platform.environment` and deliberately never sets the flag
  // itself: topping the Simulator window steals the host's focus, so that
  // stays the caller's call. See REAL_UI_TWO_PROCESS.md "Mobile campaign
  // budget".
  //
  // DELIBERATELY NOT REGISTERED IN ANY MOBILE CAMPAIGN (do not "fix" these by
  // adding them):
  //   * `sweep_p1_relaunch` / `sweep_p2_keys` — both restart a peer via
  //     `Process.run('tool/mcp_test/stop_toxee_instance.sh' /
  //     'launch_toxee_instance.sh')` (drive_real_ui_pair_p1_relaunch.dart:773
  //     / :803). Those are the macOS DESKTOP single-instance launchers:
  //     pointing them at an iOS/Android pair would boot a macOS Toxee.app and
  //     overwrite the pair manifest, so the "restarted peer" would not be the
  //     device under test and the rest of the run would drive the wrong
  //     process.
  //   * `sweep_p2_verify` — `paste_image_into_composer` needs an IMAGE on the
  //     host pasteboard; the portable seam (`l3_set_clipboard`) is text-only,
  //     so the precondition cannot be constructed on a device.
  //   * `sweep_group_mention` — `osaType('@')` IS the trigger under assertion.
  //     Substituting an l3/skill text seam would bypass the exact keystroke
  //     path the case exists to prove, leaving a green case that asserted
  //     nothing.
  //   * the four `*_optimized` bundles — pure re-orchestration of sweeps that
  //     are already listed here; they would only double-count the same cases.
  //   * `sweep_mobile_shell` in any `rui-ipad-*` campaign, and
  //     `sweep_tablet_layout` in any iPhone campaign — on the wrong form
  //     factor every case SKIPs, which inflates the skip tally without adding
  //     any coverage.

  // ---- iPhone (rui-ios-*, plus the platform-agnostic rui-mobile-shell) ----
  // iOS true-App first-pass coverage. These sweeps start from fresh accounts
  // and establish any needed friendship/group state internally, so they do not
  // rely on the macOS-only restored Fixture C pair.
  // `sweep_keyed_gaps` rides along here (and in the iPad/Android twins below)
  // instead of getting its own campaign: it is single-instance,
  // required=no-friend / result=no-friend, and it drives the SAME LoginPage /
  // RegisterPage surface `sweep_login` already logs out onto — so the runner
  // reuses one launch and inserts no reset. Its input path is `focusType` only
  // (real paste on desktop, flutter_skill `enterText` on a device), with ZERO
  // `osa*` chords, so it is honest on a Simulator/emulator today.
  // `sweep_keyed_gaps4_login` is appended for the same reason as
  // `sweep_keyed_gaps`: single-instance, required=no-friend / result=no-friend,
  // and it drives the SAME LoginPage surface `sweep_login` already logs out
  // onto (it registers a throwaway account, deletes it through the real
  // LoginPage confirm dialog and quick-logs back into the primary in a
  // `finally`). Its only input path is `focusType`, which is atomic on every
  // platform, so there are no `osa*` chords to be silent on a Simulator.
