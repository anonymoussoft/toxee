// MESSAGE MULTI-SELECT cases — the surface behind `message_menu_item:multiSelect`.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `message_menu_item:multiSelect` was one of the keyed-but-
// never-driven menu actions: no scenario had ever entered select mode, so the
// ENTIRE multi-select surface (the toolbar that REPLACES the composer, its
// delete/forward affordances, the delete confirmation dialog, and the select-mode
// header bar) was dark. Those widgets had no keys at all until this batch; the
// keys added alongside these cases are catalogued in
// `lib/ui/testing/ui_keys_fork.dart` (class `ForkUiKeys`).
//
// WHICH BUBBLE CAN EVEN ENTER SELECT MODE (verified by reading the fork, not
// assumed). `tencent_cloud_chat_message_item_with_menu_container.dart` strips
// `_uikit_multi_message` from the menu for TEXT bubbles AND for
// file/image/video/sound bubbles. What is left is the CUSTOM bubble — the same
// bubble `reply_quote_real` drives for the Reply item, and for the same reason.
// So every case here seeds an inbound CUSTOM message through `l3_inject_c2c_custom`
// (the identical seam sweep_p2_reply uses) and long-presses / right-clicks THAT
// row.
//
// WHY A MISSING multiSelect ENTRY IS A **FAILURE**, NOT A SKIP. The custom
// bubble is the LAST bubble type that still carries `_uikit_multi_message`; it
// is the only door into the entire select-mode surface. If a fork sync ever
// strips it there too, every assertion in this file becomes unreachable. Were
// that reported as a SKIP, the sweep would go green-ish (`finish()` only
// returns 75 when NOTHING passed, and these cases are chained with others that
// do pass) and the whole multi-select surface would silently stop being
// covered — the exact "coverage evaporates without anyone noticing" failure
// mode this batch exists to prevent. So `_mselEnterSelectMode` returns FALSE
// there, and prints the diagnosis. Both halves of the regression are caught:
// the SOURCE half by `test/fork_message_multi_select_menu_test.dart` (runs in
// the device-free `flutter test` gate, so a bad fork sync is red before any
// campaign is even launched), the RUNTIME half by this FAIL.
//
// THERE IS NO SKIP LEFT IN THIS FILE — the last one was RETRACTED as false.
// `_mselForwardSurface` used to SKIP when the multi-select toolbar rendered no
// forward affordance, on the claim that `enableMessageForwardIndividually` /
// `enableMessageForwardCombined` are product CONFIG toggles a build may
// legitimately turn off. In toxee they are not toggles at all, and the SKIP was
// unreachable by construction:
//   * `enableMessageForwardIndividually` is pinned TRUE — toxee sets it in
//     `lib/ui/home_page_bootstrap.dart:683` and the fork's own
//     `TencentCloudChatMessageDefaultMessageSelectionOptionsConfig` default is
//     also true, so no code path yields false.
//   * `enableMessageForwardCombined` is pinned FALSE — the fork's select-mode
//     container hardcodes it (`..._input_select_mode_container.dart:43`) until
//     the Tox-side merger elem exists, ignoring whatever the app config says.
// The phone builder gates its single forward icon on
// `enableMessageForwardCombined || enableMessageForwardIndividually`
// (`..._input_select_mode.dart:190`) = `false || true` = ALWAYS TRUE, and the
// tablet/desktop builders gate their direct button on Individually alone —
// also always true. So "no forward affordance" can never mean "config off"; it
// can only mean the toolbar did not mount, which is a product/fork regression
// and is now reported as a FAIL carrying that diagnosis.
//
// ASSERTION DISCIPLINE. Every case asserts an observable side effect, never
// "the tap did not throw":
//   * enter/cancel  — the select-mode header (`message_select_count_text`,
//                     `message_select_cancel_button`) and the toolbar
//                     (`message_select_delete_button`) MOUNT, then UNMOUNT after
//                     the real Cancel tap.
//   * delete-cancel — the confirmation dialog's two keyed actions mount, Cancel
//                     dismisses them, the message ROW is still in the tree AND
//                     still in the conversation history, and select mode is
//                     still up (the dialog cancel must not leave select mode).
//   * delete-confirm— the row is GONE from the tree, the message is GONE from
//                     history, and select mode exited by itself
//                     (`onDeleteForMe` sets `inSelectMode = false`).
//   * forward       — the real forward TARGET picker mounts
//                     (`forward_picker_send_button`), then unmounts after the
//                     picker's Cancel. Nothing is actually forwarded, so the
//                     case leaves no state behind.
//
// FORM FACTOR. The toolbar renders on every form factor, but its forward
// affordance differs by builder: the PHONE `defaultBuilder` shows ONE icon that
// opens a bottom sheet of forward types, while tablet/desktop render the
// per-type buttons directly. The forward case DETECTS which is mounted (it does
// not guess from the platform, and a narrowed desktop window keeps the desktop
// builder), and drives that path. Everything else is shared Dart, so an iOS /
// Android / desktop run exercises the same widgets — these cases are registered
// in the mobile campaign matrix for exactly that reason.
//
// INPUT PATH. No `osa*` keystroke is used anywhere here (a silent no-op on
// iOS/Android — see drive_real_ui_pair_mobile_shell.dart's input-path rule):
// only real taps through `tapKeyCenter` / `tryTapKey`, the long-press/right-click
// menu opener `_openMessageMenuReal`, and the ungated l3 seed seam.
//
// NOT VERIFIED BY EXECUTION: authored offline; no campaign run has driven these
// cases yet.
