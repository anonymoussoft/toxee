# toxee Account and Session
> Language: [Chinese](ACCOUNT_AND_SESSION.md) | [English](ACCOUNT_AND_SESSION.en.md)


This document describes the current account lifecycle implementation of toxee, focusing on automatic login, manual login, registration, switching accounts, logging out, deleting accounts, and how to handle password-protected profiles.

## 1. Division of roles

- `AccountService`: Unified encapsulation of account initialization, registration, destruction, and deletion.
- `_StartupGate`: Automatic login portal, responsible for the first screen startup sequence and connection waiting.
- `LoginPage`: Quick login for existing accounts, new account entrance, and account deletion on the login page.
- `AccountSwitcher`: Reuse `AccountService` when switching accounts on the settings page.
- `SettingsPage`: UI entrance for logging out, exporting, and deleting accounts.
- `SessionPasswordStore`: Only save the password of this session in memory to re-encrypt `tox_profile.tox` when exiting.

## 2. Account initialization

The main entrance for existing accounts is `AccountService.initializeServiceForAccount(...)`.

Core steps:

1. Set up the current account `toxId`.
2. Migrate the old directory to a storage structure isolated by account.
3. Parse historical messages, offline queues, received file directories, and avatar directories.
4. Restore or migrate `tox_profile.tox`.
5. If the account has a password, first decrypt the profile and put the password into `SessionPasswordStore`.
6. Create `FfiChatService` and inject `SharedPreferencesAdapter`, `AppLoggerAdapter`, and `BootstrapNodesAdapter`.
7. Execute `init(profileContents: ...)`, `login(...)`, `updateSelfProfile(...)`.
8. Depending on the caller's needs, decide whether to `startPolling()` immediately.

## 3. Startup path

### Automatic login

The current order of `_StartupGate._decide()` in `main.dart` is:

1. Read the automatic login configuration and current account.
2. Restore the account through `AccountService.initializeServiceForAccount(..., startPolling: false)`.
3. Call `FakeUIKit.startWithFfi(service)` to start the UIKit side state in advance.
4. Call `_initTIMManagerSDK()`.
5. Call `service.startPolling()`.
6. Wait for successful connection or timeout.
7. Preload friend and contact status.
8. Navigate to `HomePage(service)`.

### Manual login

There is already an account in `LoginPage` and `AccountService.initializeServiceForAccount(...)` will be reused first. Only historical compatible paths will manually create `FfiChatService` and execute `init()`, `login()`, `updateSelfProfile()`, `startPolling()`.

## 4. Registration path

`AccountService.registerNewAccount(...)` current process:

1. Clear the current account and ensure that the empty state is loaded during new registration.
2. Initialize `FfiChatService` in the temporary directory and generate a new `toxId`.
3. Rename the temporary profile directory to the official account directory.
4. Update nickname and status message.
5. Write the account list, current account and metadata.
6. If a password is set, first encrypt and then decrypt the profile for verification, and then reinitialize the service according to the account isolation directory.
7. Finally start `startPolling()` and return to the new service.

## 5. Switch, exit and delete

### Switch account

`AccountSwitcher.switchAccount(...)` will:

1. Call `AccountService.teardownCurrentSession(...)` to destroy the old session.
2. Verify the target account password.
3. Recall `initializeServiceForAccount(...)` to restore the target account.
4. Navigate to the new `HomePage`.

### Log out

`SettingsPage._logout()` will call `AccountService.teardownCurrentSession(service: widget.service)`, then clear the current account ID and return to the login page.

### Delete account

- Setting page deletion: calling `AccountService.deleteAccountCompletely(...)` will teardown first, then clean up prefs, account list, profile directory and account data directory.
- Login page deletion: Call `AccountService.deleteAccountWithoutService(...)` because there is no running service at this time.

## 6. Session destruction sequence

`AccountService.teardownCurrentSession(...)` The current sequence is as follows:

1. `FakeUIKit.instance.dispose()`
2. If the current Platform is `Tim2ToxSdkPlatform`, first `dispose()`, and then restore to the default `MethodChannelTencentCloudChatSdk`
3. Clear `ChatDataProviderRegistry` and `ChatMessageProviderRegistry`
4. Clean up static caches such as `GroupMemberListDebouncer` and `IrcAppManager`
5. `service.dispose()`
6. If the current session uses a password, re-encrypt `tox_profile.tox` on disk
7. Clean up `SessionPasswordStore`

The key point of this sequence is: `FakeUIKit` must be destroyed before `Tim2ToxSdkPlatform`, otherwise the cleanup of the call bridge and signaling listener will lose dependencies.

## 7. Storage model

Each account has an independent running directory:

-`tox_profile.tox`
-`chat_history/`
-`offline_message_queue.json`
-`avatars/`
- `file_recv/`

These paths are generated uniformly by `AppPaths` to prevent multiple accounts from sharing the same historical data or cache.

## 8. Password and profile encryption

- The password hash is saved in the persistent configuration and used to verify the account password.
- The session plaintext password is only stored in the `SessionPasswordStore` memory and will not be lost to disk.
- If the profile is found to be encrypted when logging in, it will be decrypted first.
- If there is a password for this session when logging out, `tox_profile.tox` will be re-encrypted.
- There will be no re-encryption when deleting the account, because the profile will be deleted directly.
