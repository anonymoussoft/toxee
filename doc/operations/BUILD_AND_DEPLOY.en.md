# toxee Build and Deploy
> Language: [Chinese](BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md) | [English](BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.en.md)

This document covers the current build and packaging flow for toxee: local development builds, local packaging, and the GitHub Actions workflow that publishes GitHub Releases. For build failures, startup crashes, bootstrap issues, or runtime debugging, start with [TROUBLESHOOTING.en.md](../TROUBLESHOOTING.en.md).

## Environment requirements

### Core tools

- **Flutter**: use Flutter `3.29.x` or newer compatible with the checked-in lockfile. The current CI workflows use `3.29.0`, and `pubspec.lock` currently requires Flutter `>=3.29.0`.
- **Dart**: use the Dart SDK bundled with the selected Flutter version.
- **Git**: required for submodules and dependency bootstrap.
- **CMake**: `3.16+` is the safest baseline. Parts of the tree build with lower minimums, but Tim2Tox and the Windows installer path both use `3.16`.

### Platform-specific requirements

- **macOS**: Xcode, Command Line Tools, Homebrew, `libsodium`, and `create-dmg` if you want `.dmg` packaging.
- **Linux**: `build-essential`, `cmake`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `libsodium-dev`, `pkg-config`, `patchelf`, and `libfuse2`; `appimagetool` is needed for `.AppImage` packaging.
- **Windows**: Visual Studio 2019/2022, PowerShell, CMake, and WiX Toolset v3 if you want `.msi` packaging. `vcpkg` is used in CI to install `libsodium`.
- **Android**: Android SDK, Android NDK, and Java 17.
- **iOS**: Xcode and CocoaPods. For a distributable IPA you also need signing materials (certificate + provisioning profile).

## Quick paths

### Fastest local run

From the repository root:

```bash
dart run tool/bootstrap_deps.dart
flutter pub get
./run_toxee.sh
```

`run_toxee.sh` is the shortest path for local macOS development. It bootstraps dependencies when needed, builds the native pieces, launches the app, and writes logs such as:

- `build/native_build.log`
- `build/flutter_build.log`
- `build/flutter_client.log`

### Fastest cross-platform local build

```bash
./build_all.sh --platform macos --mode debug
./build_all.sh --platform linux --mode release
./build_all.sh --platform windows --mode release
./build_all.sh --platform android --mode release
./build_all.sh --platform ios --mode release
```

`build_all.sh` builds the Tim2Tox native library first, runs dependency bootstrap, and then executes the platform Flutter build.

### Fastest CI-backed release

- Push a tag such as `v1.2.3` to trigger [`.github/workflows/build-packages.yml`](../../.github/workflows/build-packages.yml).
- Or trigger `workflow_dispatch`, set `publish_release=true`, and provide `release_tag`.

## Local build flow

### 1. Bootstrap dependencies

Fresh clones and dependency updates must start here:

```bash
dart run tool/bootstrap_deps.dart
```

This initializes the required submodules, fetches and patches vendored SDK content, and refreshes `pubspec_overrides.yaml`.

### 2. Install Flutter packages

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Build for a platform

Examples:

```bash
# macOS
flutter build macos --debug

# Linux
flutter build linux --release

# Windows
flutter build windows --release

# Android
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS validation build
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```

If you already rely on the project scripts, `./build_all.sh` and `./run_toxee.sh` are the preferred entry points over manually repeating every step.

### 4. Package installables locally

After a successful platform build, you can package installables with:

```bash
bash tool/ci/package_artifacts.sh --target linux --mode release
bash tool/ci/package_artifacts.sh --target windows --mode release
bash tool/ci/package_artifacts.sh --target macos --mode release
bash tool/ci/package_artifacts.sh --target android --mode release
bash tool/ci/package_artifacts.sh --target ios --mode release
```

Those commands write outputs into `dist/<platform>/`.

## Package outputs

Current packaging outputs are:

| Platform | Main outputs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows** | `dist/windows/toxee-windows-x64-release.msi`, `dist/windows/toxee-windows-x64-release.zip` | The `.msi` path depends on CPack + WiX being available. |
| **macOS** | `dist/macos/toxee-macos-release.dmg`, `dist/macos/toxee-macos-release.zip` | The `.dmg` path depends on `create-dmg`. |
| **Linux** | `dist/linux/toxee-linux-x64-release.AppImage`, `dist/linux/toxee-linux-x64-release.tar.gz` | The `.AppImage` path depends on `appimagetool`. |
| **Android** | `dist/android/app-release.apk`, `dist/android/app-release.aab` | `NOTES.txt` records whether Tim2Tox JNI libs were staged. |
| **iOS** | `dist/ios/toxee-ios-release.ipa` | Can be a signed IPA or an unsigned validation IPA, depending on signing state. |

Desktop packaging also tries to bundle the Tim2Tox native library and `libsodium` into the packaged app output, and records the result in `dist/<platform>/NOTES.txt`.

## GitHub Actions packages and releases

The repository ships with [`.github/workflows/build-packages.yml`](../../.github/workflows/build-packages.yml). It runs on:

- `push` to `main` / `master`
- tag push for `v*`
- `pull_request`
- `workflow_dispatch`

It builds packages for:

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS
- Android
- iOS

Each platform job uploads `dist/<platform>/` as a workflow artifact. When the run is a version tag push, or when manual dispatch sets `publish_release=true`, the same workflow also:

- downloads the artifacts from the current run
- collects installables that passed release gating
- publishes them to GitHub Releases
- uploads `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- uploads merged platform notes as `BUILD-NOTES.txt`

The current desktop release assets are:

- **Windows**: `.msi` plus `.zip`
- **macOS**: `.dmg` plus `.zip`
- **Linux**: `.AppImage` plus `.tar.gz`

## Signing and native-library gating

### Android

- Release signing is optional. If `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, and `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` are present, CI uses them.
- If the Tim2Tox JNI set (`libtim2tox_ffi.so`) was **not** staged, CI still records the APK/AAB in the workflow artifact, but the GitHub Release publish step skips them. The reason is written into `dist/android/NOTES.txt` and merged into `BUILD-NOTES.txt`.

### iOS

- A distributable IPA requires `IOS_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`, `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, and `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`.
- Without those secrets, CI still performs an unsigned validation build and packages an unsigned IPA in the workflow artifact.
- Unsigned validation IPAs are **not** uploaded to GitHub Releases. The publish step skips them and keeps the explanation in `BUILD-NOTES.txt`.

### Desktop

- Desktop packages are the only assets currently guaranteed to land on GitHub Releases without extra mobile signing/native-library prerequisites.
- Release packaging attempts to bundle Tim2Tox FFI and `libsodium` into the app/package output, then records the exact result in `NOTES.txt`.

## Useful commands

```bash
# Dependency bootstrap
dart run tool/bootstrap_deps.dart
